          <h2 class="section-title">What is the NDIS early childhood pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            The NDIS early childhood pathway is a way for young children with disability or developmental
            concerns to access support earlier in life. You may also hear it called the
            <strong>“early childhood approach”</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The focus is on early intervention – providing the right help as soon as possible, so your child
            has the best chance to build skills, participate and feel confident at home, in the community and
            in education settings.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Who is it for?</h2>
          <p>The early childhood pathway is generally designed for:</p>

          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Children under around 9 years of age</li>
            <li>Children with a diagnosed disability</li>
            <li>Children with developmental delay or emerging concerns</li>
            <li>Families who have been advised to “watch and see” but still feel worried</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Every child and family situation is different. Some children will access full NDIS plans, while
            others may receive short-term or lighter-touch supports through early childhood partners.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Typical steps in the early childhood pathway</h2>
          <p>
            While the process can look slightly different depending on where you live, these are common steps
            families experience:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Noticing concerns</h3>
          <p>
            You, a teacher, doctor or therapist may notice that your child’s development, communication,
            behaviour or participation is different to what’s expected for their age.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Talking to professionals</h3>
          <p>
            Most families start by speaking with a <strong>GP, paediatrician, maternal &amp; child health nurse
            or kinder/school</strong>. They may suggest assessments, monitoring or referral to an NDIS early
            childhood partner.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Contacting the NDIS early childhood team</h3>
          <p>
            You can contact the NDIS or your local early childhood partner to discuss your child. They may
            ask questions about:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Areas you’re concerned about (speech, behaviour, motor skills, social skills, etc.)</li>
            <li>How your child manages at home, kinder or school</li>
            <li>Any existing reports or assessments</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Assessment and eligibility</h3>
          <p>
            The NDIS will consider whether your child meets criteria for:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Early intervention supports, or</li>
            <li>Access to the NDIS as a longer-term participant</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You may be asked to provide reports from therapists, doctors or other professionals. If you don’t
            have these yet, this can be part of what you work toward.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Planning meeting</h3>
          <p>
            If your child is eligible for an NDIS plan, you’ll have a planning conversation to talk about:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Your child’s strengths and challenges</li>
            <li>Daily routines at home and in the community</li>
            <li>What’s working well and what’s hard right now</li>
            <li>Your goals for the next 12–24 months</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You can bring a support person, support coordinator or another trusted person to this meeting.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Receiving the plan &amp; starting supports</h3>
          <p>
            Once your child’s plan is approved, you can begin:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Connecting with therapists (OT, speech, psychology, physio, etc.)</li>
            <li>Engaging family-centred support at home</li>
            <li>Accessing community and early learning supports</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This is where families often feel overwhelmed – juggling appointments, waitlists and paperwork.
            This is also where services like <a href="/services/support-coordination">Support Coordination</a>
            and <a href="/services/allied-health-access">Allied Health Access</a> can help.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Reviewing progress</h3>
          <p>
            NDIS plans are reviewed regularly. You’ll talk about what’s improved, what’s still hard and whether
            your child’s supports or goals need to change.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">What supports can be included?</h2>
          <p>
            Every child’s plan is different, but early childhood supports may include a mix of:
          </p>

          <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Occupational therapy (OT)</strong> – for sensory needs, everyday skills, emotional regulation and participation</li>
            <li><strong>Speech therapy</strong> – for communication, understanding, speech sounds and social interaction</li>
            <li><strong>Physiotherapy</strong> – for gross motor skills, strength, balance and mobility</li>
            <li><strong>Psychology or counselling</strong> – for emotional wellbeing and behaviour</li>
            <li><strong>Behaviour support</strong> – for behaviours of concern, safety and structured strategies</li>
            <li><strong>Family coaching and parent support</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Support workers</strong> – to help with routines, community access and practising strategies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Supports should link back to your child’s goals – not just “more therapy”, but therapy that is
            meaningful and sustainable for your family.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Your role as a parent or caregiver</h2>
          <p>
            You are the expert in your child. The NDIS early childhood pathway works best when professionals
            and parents work together.
          </p>

          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Share your observations – even if you’re not sure they’re “important enough”</li>
            <li>Ask questions if something isn’t clear</li>
            <li>Let services know what is realistic for your family’s time, energy and capacity</li>
            <li>Speak up if something isn’t working or feels overwhelming</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You do not need to be perfect or have all the answers – your role is to be your child’s voice and
            advocate, with support around you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Questions to ask at your early childhood planning meeting</h2>
          <p>
            Many parents aren’t sure what to ask. Here are some gentle, practical questions that can help:
          </p>

          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>“Can you explain this part of the plan in simpler language?”</li>
            <li>“What supports could help with mornings, mealtimes or bedtime?”</li>
            <li>“How can this funding be used to support our whole family, not just individual appointments?”</li>
            <li>“What type of therapists typically support children with similar needs?”</li>
            <li>“What should I do if the supports we choose don’t feel like the right fit?”</li>
            <li>“How will we know if the plan is working well?”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You are allowed to take notes, bring someone with you and ask for information to be repeated.
          </p>

          <hr style="margin:2.5rem 0;">

          <h2 class="section-title">Feeling overwhelmed by the NDIS early childhood pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            You’re not alone. Many families tell us they feel exhausted by forms, assessments and appointments
            before they even start.
          </p>
