        <p>
          The NDIS can feel complicated — lots of paperwork, acronyms, providers and phone calls.
          Support Coordination is about having someone walk alongside you to make sense of your plan,
          connect you with the right supports and problem-solve challenges as they arise.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-subtext">

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">What Is NDIS Support Coordination?</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Support Coordination is a funded NDIS service designed to help you understand, organise and
        use your plan. Instead of trying to coordinate everything alone, you have someone who can:
        explain your funding, connect you to services, help things run smoothly and support you to
        build your own capacity over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see Support Coordination as a partnership. You remain in control of your choices; we
        bring clarity, organisation and advocacy to help your plan work for you — not the other way
        around.

  <!-- HOW WE WORK -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach to Support Coordination</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Every participant, family and situation is different. Our approach is grounded in empathy,
        realistic expectations and honest communication.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">
        <div class="step-card">
          <span class="step-number">1</span>
          <h3>We Listen to Your Story</h3>
          <p>
            We begin by understanding what life looks like for you — your strengths, challenges,
            family situation, culture, preferences and hopes for the future. We don’t jump straight
            to “services” without hearing your story first.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-card">
          <span class="step-number">2</span>
          <h3>We Build a Realistic Plan Together</h3>
          <p>
            We work with you to create a practical support map based on your funding, priorities
            and energy. This includes which supports to engage first, and how they might fit into
            your routine.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-card">
          <span class="step-number">3</span>
          <h3>We Walk Alongside You</h3>
          <p>
            We don’t just “set up” supports and disappear. We check in regularly, adjust when things
            aren’t working, and support you to develop skills and confidence to direct your own
            supports over time.

            Support Coordination can be especially helpful if:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>You feel overwhelmed by the NDIS language and processes</li>
            <li>You have multiple providers or complex supports</li>

            <li>You’re newly approved for an NDIS plan and don’t know where to start</li>
            <li>You’re preparing for a plan reassessment or review</li>

  <!-- COMPLEX NEEDS & COLLABORATION -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Supporting Participants With Complex Needs</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Many of the people we work with experience multiple challenges at once — physical health
        needs, mental health, communication differences, trauma history, housing instability or
        family pressures. We understand that life around the NDIS can be messy and complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these situations, Support Coordination can make a big difference. We liaise with your
        broader support team (where appropriate), such as therapists, GPs, schools, hospitals,
        housing services and community organisations, to help keep information flowing and ensure
        supports stay focused on your priorities.

          <h3>Working With Families & Carers</h3>
          <p>
            With your consent, we involve family members or key carers in planning, communication
            and review. We recognise the important role they play and make space for their insight
            and concerns.

          <h3>Respecting Culture, Faith & Identity</h3>
          <p>
            Your cultural background, faith, language and identity shape what “good support” means
            to you. We respect and incorporate these in provider selection and planning where
            possible.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Calm, Honest Conversations</h3>

            We aim to be honest and realistic about capacity, waitlists and service options — without
            giving up on advocating for what you need. Our communication is clear, kind and
            straightforward.

  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Support Coordination – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-2">

        <div>
          <h3>Do I have Support Coordination in my plan?</h3>
          <p>
            Not every plan includes Support Coordination. It is usually listed as a separate line
            item under Capacity Building funding. If you’re unsure, we can help you read your plan
            or check with the NDIS or your plan manager.
          </p>

          <h3>What’s the difference between Support Coordination and Plan Management?</h3>
          <p>
            Plan Management focuses on paying invoices and managing your NDIS budget. Support
            Coordination focuses on helping you understand and use your plan, connect with services
            and coordinate supports. Many participants have both.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you choose providers for me?</h3>
          <p>
            We can suggest options, share information and help you compare providers, but the final
            choice is always yours. Our role is to support informed decision-making, not to decide
            for you.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you attend appointments or meetings with me?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes — where appropriate and funded, we can attend meetings with you (for example, plan
            reassessments or provider meetings) to help explain things and make sure your voice is
            heard.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help if I’m unhappy with a provider?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We can support you to raise concerns respectfully, explore alternatives, and
            transition to other providers if needed, always with your safety and preferences in mind.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Do you provide Specialist Support Coordination (Level 3)?</h3>
          <p>
            At this stage, our focus is on Level 2/standard Support Coordination. If you require
            Specialist Support Coordination due to very complex or high-risk circumstances, we can
            discuss whether we are the right fit or help you look at other options.
          </p>

          <h3>Can Support Coordination be provided remotely?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, some aspects can be done over phone, email or video, especially for participants
            in regional or remote areas or during health restrictions.
          </p>

          <h3>How often will I hear from my Support Coordinator?</h3>
          <p>
            That depends on your plan, needs and preferences. Some participants need frequent
            contact; others only need occasional check-ins. We agree on this together at the start.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you work with my existing support team?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes — with your permission, we can liaise with your therapists, GP, school, support
            workers and other services to keep everyone aligned around your goals.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I start Support Coordination with Able Aide?</h3>
          <p>
            You can contact us directly, speak with your plan manager, or ask your existing Support
            Coordinator or provider to send us a referral. We’ll then confirm funding, capacity and
            next steps.
