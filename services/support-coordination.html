<!-- WHAT IS SUPPORT COORDINATION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">What Is NDIS Support Coordination?</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      Support Coordination is a funded NDIS service that helps you understand, organise and use your plan.
      Instead of coordinating everything alone, you have someone who can explain your funding,
      connect you with services, and support you to build your own capacity over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      We see Support Coordination as a partnership. You remain in control of your choices; we bring
      clarity, organisation and advocacy to help your plan work for you — not the other way around.

<!-- HOW WE WORK -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach to Support Coordination</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Every participant, family and situation is different. Our approach is grounded in empathy,
      realistic expectations and honest communication.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">1</span>
        <h3>We Listen to Your Story</h3>
        <p class="small">
          We begin by understanding what life looks like for you — your strengths, challenges,
          family situation, culture, preferences and hopes for the future.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">2</span>
        <h3>We Build a Realistic Plan</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Together we create a practical support map based on your funding, priorities
          and energy — what to engage first and how it fits into your routine.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">3</span>
        <h3>We Walk Alongside You</h3>
        <p class="small">
          We don’t just “set up” supports and disappear. We check in, adjust when things aren’t working,
          and support you to direct your own supports over time.

    <div class="grid grid-2" style="margin-top:2rem;">

      <div>
        <p class="small">Support Coordination can be especially helpful if:</p>
        <ul class="checklist small">
          <li>You feel overwhelmed by NDIS language and processes</li>
          <li>You have multiple providers or complex supports</li>

          <li>You’re preparing for a plan reassessment or review</li>
          <li>You want someone independent to help coordinate everything</li>

<!-- COMPLEX NEEDS & COLLABORATION -->

    <h2 class="section-title">Supporting Participants With Complex Needs</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      Many people we work with experience multiple challenges at once — health needs, mental health,
      communication differences, trauma history, housing pressures or family stress.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these situations, Support Coordination can make a big difference. With your consent, we can liaise with
      your broader support team such as therapists, GPs, schools, hospitals, housing services and community
      organisations to keep information flowing and supports focused on your priorities.

        <h3>Working With Families & Carers</h3>
        <p class="small">
          With your consent, we involve family or key carers in planning, communication and review,
          recognising the important role they play.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Respecting Culture, Faith & Identity</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Your culture, language, faith and identity shape what “good support” means.
          We respect this in planning and provider selection wherever possible.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Calm, Honest Conversations</h3>
        <p class="small">
          We are honest about capacity, waitlists and service options — while still advocating
          for what you need. Communication is clear, kind and straightforward.

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="section section-alt">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">Support Coordination – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="grid grid-2" style="margin-top:2rem;">

      <div>
        <h3>Do I have Support Coordination in my plan?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Not every plan includes it. It is usually listed as a separate line item under
          Capacity Building funding. If you’re unsure, we can help you read your plan or check
          with the NDIS or your plan manager.
        </p>

        <h3>What’s the difference between Support Coordination and Plan Management?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Plan Management focuses on paying invoices and managing your NDIS budget.
          Support Coordination focuses on helping you understand and use your plan, connect with
          services and coordinate supports. Many participants have both.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you choose providers for me?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          We can suggest options, share information and help you compare providers,
          but the final choice is always yours.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you attend appointments or meetings with me?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Where appropriate and funded, we can attend meetings (for example, plan reassessments or
          provider meetings) to support you and help explain things.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you help if I’m unhappy with a provider?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Yes. We can support you to raise concerns, explore alternatives and transition to
          other providers if needed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Do you provide Specialist Support Coordination (Level 3)?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Our focus is on Level 2 / standard Support Coordination. If you require Level 3 due
          to very complex or high-risk circumstances, we can discuss whether we’re the right fit
          or help you look at other options.
        </p>

        <h3>Can Support Coordination be provided remotely?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Yes — many aspects can be done via phone, email or video, especially for participants
          in regional areas.
        </p>

        <h3>How often will I hear from my Support Coordinator?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          This depends on your plan, needs and preferences. Some people prefer frequent contact,
          others only occasional check-ins. We decide this together.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you work with my existing support team?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          Yes — with your consent, we can liaise with therapists, GP, school, support workers and
          other services to keep everyone aligned around your goals.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I start with Able Aide?</h3>
        <p class="small">
          You can contact us directly, speak with your plan manager or ask a provider to send us
          a referral. We’ll confirm funding, capacity and next steps.
