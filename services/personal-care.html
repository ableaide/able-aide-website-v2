      <h1>Personal Care & Daily Living Support</h1>
      <p>
        Personal care is one of the most important forms of support a person can receive. It involves
        trust, dignity and a level of comfort that takes time to build. At Able Aide, we take that
        responsibility seriously. Our approach is gentle, respectful and culturally aware, ensuring
        your preferences, communication needs and routines always come first.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-subtext">
        Whether you need support with showering, dressing, grooming, mobility, meal preparation,
        medication reminders or daily routines, we work at your pace — never rushed, always respectful.

      <h2>Support that respects your comfort and choices</h2>
      <p>
        We understand how personal and sensitive this type of support can be. That’s why we focus on
        communication, consistency and relationship-building — so every interaction feels calm, predictable
        and empowering.

    <h2 class="section-title">Support Designed Around Your Daily Life</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      Daily living tasks can take a significant amount of energy — physically, emotionally or mentally.
      For some people, they may require assistance due to mobility challenges, medical conditions,
      developmental differences, sensory needs, chronic pain, fatigue or recovering from an injury or
      surgery. Others simply want a reliable, consistent support worker they trust in their home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our personal care support meets you where you are. Whether you prefer quiet, step-by-step guidance,
      need support for safety, want to build your independence, or require full physical assistance,
      we tailor our approach to match your comfort, ability and preferences. We also understand the
      importance of privacy and maintaining dignity — especially during intimate tasks like showering
      or dressing.

<!-- OUR APPROACH -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">

    <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach to Personal Care</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      We believe exceptional personal care is not defined by the tasks themselves —
      it’s defined by how they’re delivered. Our focus is on trust, dignity, communication and
      respecting your individual differences.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">1</span>
        <h3>We Listen First</h3>
        <p>
          Before we begin any support, we take the time to understand your preferences:
          how you like your shower set up, which products you use, which parts of the routine
          you want to do yourself and what you need help with.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">2</span>
        <h3>We Work At Your Pace</h3>
        <p>
          Some mornings are fast. Others need to move slowly. We adjust to how you're feeling
          and never rush or push beyond your comfort level.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">3</span>
        <h3>We Provide Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          Wherever possible, we match you with the same support workers so your routines become
          familiar and predictable — especially important for participants with sensory needs,
          autism, anxiety or trauma history.

    <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="grid grid-2">

      <div>

        <h3>Do I choose my own support worker?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Matching matters. You can request workers based on gender, communication style,
          language, cultural background or personality.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I change workers if I feel uncomfortable?</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely. Your comfort always comes first. If you feel unsure, unsafe or simply prefer
          someone different, we will make a change without hesitation.
        </p>

        <h3>Is personal care funded by the NDIS?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes — it is funded as a Core Support under “Assistance with Daily Life.”
        </p>

        <h3>Do you support people with complex care needs?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, including participants with limited mobility, intellectual disability, autism,
          sensory needs, mental health conditions, or challenging routines. Clinical tasks requiring
          nursing, however, must be delivered by qualified clinicians.
        </p>

        <h3>Will workers follow my therapy plan?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes — we can follow strategies from your OT, physio or speech therapist to support
          consistent progress at home.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <h3>Are workers trained in manual handling?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes — all support workers receive training in safe transfers, positioning and mobility to
          reduce risk and ensure safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you support children?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes — we provide age-appropriate personal care routines for children and teens, always
          respecting family values and safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to prepare my home before workers arrive?</h3>
        <p>
          No — support is designed to help you manage daily life realistically, not perfectly.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you help after hospital discharge?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes — we can support personal care transitions from hospital to home, working with your
          therapists or discharge team.
        </p>

        <h3>What if I feel embarrassed about needing help?</h3>
        <p>
          Many participants feel this way at first. Our workers are calm, kind and skilled at helping
          people feel safe and respected during intimate tasks.
