      <h2 class="section-title">How We Support You in the Community</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        Community access means more than going from point A to point B. It’s about feeling confident,
        reducing stress, practicing skills, and staying connected with the people and activities that matter to you.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Appointments & errands</h3>
          <p>
            We provide support to attend medical appointments, therapy sessions, school or TAFE,
            job interviews, or NDIS meetings. We stay with you if needed to take notes, translate information,
            or provide reassurance.
          </p>

            markets, concerts or nature walks. Supports can be regular or occasional.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Confidence-building</h3>
          <p>
            If you feel anxious or overwhelmed in public spaces, we work together to gradually build confidence
            through paced exposure, planning and reassurance.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Transport support</h3>
