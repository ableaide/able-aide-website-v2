      <p>
        Being part of the community is essential for wellbeing. Whether it’s attending
        appointments, going shopping, joining activities, seeing friends, or simply
        spending time outdoors, community access helps build confidence, independence
        and connection.

      Community access means more than “going out” — it’s about having the freedom
      to participate in life on your own terms. We support people with mobility,
      anxiety, sensory needs, health appointments, social connection, errands and
      confidence-building.
