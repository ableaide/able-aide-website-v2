        <h1>Family & Early Childhood Support</h1>
        <p>
          Early years are full of big changes — new diagnoses, appointments, school transitions,
          behaviour changes and emotional ups and downs. It can be a lot for children, parents
          and carers to manage alone.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-subtext">
          Able Aide provides gentle, practical support to families of children with NDIS plans
          across Victoria, focusing on daily routines, early development, behaviour, participation
          and confidence at home and in the community.

        <h2>Support for both the child and the family</h2>
        <p>
          We know that when a child needs support, the whole family feels it. Our approach is
          family-centred – we work alongside parents, carers and other supports, not instead of them.

      <h2 class="section-title">Helping Everyday Life Feel More Manageable</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        Many families tell us they feel pulled in different directions – juggling school,
        therapies, siblings, behaviour, appointments and daily tasks. Our Family & Early
        Support service is designed to reduce stress, build routines and support children’s
        participation in real-life settings, not just in appointment rooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do this by focusing on what daily life actually looks like in your home — mornings,
        evenings, mealtimes, homework, appointments, play time, transitions and meltdowns.
        Together, we work out small adjustments and consistent strategies that feel realistic
        for your family to use.

  <!-- FAMILY-CENTRED APPROACH -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Family-Centred Approach</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        We see families as the experts in their own children. Our role is to listen,
        understand and offer practical support that respects your culture, values,
        routines and parenting style.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Listening First</h3>
          <p>
            We take time to hear your story — what’s going well, what’s hard, what your
            child enjoys, and what you hope will feel different. We recognise the emotional
            load that comes with caring for a child with additional needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Working Alongside You</h3>
          <p>
            We don’t come in with judgement or quick fixes. We work with your existing
            strategies and team, and suggest small, achievable changes rather than
            overwhelming plans.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Respecting Culture & Family Dynamics</h3>
          <p>
            Every family has its own culture, faith, language and ways of doing things.
            We respect this and adapt our approach so support feels culturally safe
            and aligned with your values.

  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Family & Early Support – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-2">

        <div>
          <h3>Are you a therapy service?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Able Aide is not a clinical therapy service. We are a disability support provider.
            We work alongside your child’s therapists (for example OT, speech or psychology) to
            support the practical, everyday side of using their recommendations at home and in the
            community.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you replace my child’s therapists?</h3>
          <p>
            No. We do not replace therapists. Instead, we complement their work by helping families
            and support workers use agreed strategies in real-life routines, where this is appropriate
            and within our scope.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help if my child has behaviours of concern?</h3>
          <p>
            We can support families to follow behaviour support plans and strategies developed by
            qualified practitioners, within our scope. For complex or high-risk behaviour, specialist
            behaviour support and clinical input is essential. We are happy to be part of a larger
            support team.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you work with very young children?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We support families with children in early childhood, including those accessing
            early childhood NDIS pathways. Our focus is on everyday routines, play, participation
            and family wellbeing.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you support siblings too?</h3>
          <p>
            While the NDIS funding is for the participant, we understand that siblings are
            part of the family system. We are mindful of their needs, and consider them when
            planning routines and supports at home.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Do you work with schools or kinders?</h3>
          <p>
            With your consent, we can communicate with schools, kinders or childcare services
            where this is helpful and appropriate, especially around routines, transitions
            and consistent strategies.
          </p>

          <h3>Is this support available after school hours?</h3>
          <p>
            Where capacity allows, yes. Many families prefer after-school or early evening
            supports. We will discuss availability and what’s realistic at the time of enquiry.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help us prepare for our child’s NDIS review?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We can help you reflect on what has changed, gather relevant information,
            and prepare clear examples of how supports have helped your child and family.
          </p>

          <h3>How is this funded in the NDIS plan?</h3>
          <p>
            It will depend on your child’s goals and plan wording. Supports may sit under
            Core or Capacity Building. We can look at the plan with you and discuss options
            in plain language.
          </p>

          <h3>How do we get started?</h3>
          <p>
            You can contact us directly, ask your Support Coordinator to refer, or speak with
            a therapist or provider who can connect you with us. We’ll then talk through your
            situation, funding and what support might look like.
