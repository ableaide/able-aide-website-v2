  <!-- HOW WE SUPPORT -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">How We Support Children & Families</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        Our family & early support is flexible. It can include hands-on support with the child,
        help with routines and participation, and collaboration with parents, carers and therapists.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Daily routines</h3>
          <p>
            Support during key times of the day—mornings, after school, weekends or evenings—
            to help things run more smoothly, whether that’s getting dressed, bathing, mealtimes
            or bedtime.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Participation in activities</h3>
          <p>
            Supporting your child to participate in playgroups, kinder, early learning, community
            activities, sports, religious or cultural events where appropriate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Skill-building at their pace</h3>
          <p>
            Encouraging independence in small steps: washing hands, packing a bag, making simple
            choices, practicing communication, or following simple routines with lots of encouragement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Supporting parents & carers</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes support looks like having an extra pair of hands, another calm adult in the room,
            or someone to help share the load while you focus on other family needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Working with therapists</h3>
          <p>
            We can reinforce strategies from OTs, speech pathologists, psychologists or
            other therapists—such as visuals, communication tools, sensory strategies
            and behaviour supports (within our role).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Respect for culture & family values</h3>
          <p>
            We recognise that every family has its own culture, values, traditions and parenting styles.
            We work with you, not against you, to support your child in a way that fits your family.

      <h2 class="section-title">What Working Together Can Look Like</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="step-card">
          <span class="step-number">1</span>
          <h3>We listen to your story</h3>
          <p>
            You know your child best. We ask about their strengths, challenges, likes and dislikes, and
            what life is like at home, school or kinder.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-card">
          <span class="step-number">2</span>
          <h3>We focus on your priorities</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of telling you what should matter, we ask what actually matters to your family—less
            stress at bedtime, smoother mornings, confident outings, or more time for siblings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-card">
          <span class="step-number">3</span>
          <h3>We provide consistent support</h3>
          <p>
            As much as possible, we aim to provide familiar workers and consistent routines so your child
            feels safe, understood and supported over time.

      <p class="section-intro">
        This support suits families with young children on the NDIS who would benefit from practical,
        home- and community-based support.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            We take a whole-family view: what helps the child should also help the household.
            Our workers aim to be reliable, kind and respectful – not another source of stress.
