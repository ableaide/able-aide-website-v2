          Allied health services like occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy and

          managing waitlists and staying on top of reports can feel overwhelming.

      <h2 class="section-title">Making Allied Health Easier to Navigate</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        It’s common for participants and families to feel lost when it comes to allied health. There are
        multiple disciplines, different wait times, referral pathways and NDIS requirements. We support you
        to connect with the right therapists, understand what they recommend, and keep everything moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not an allied health clinic ourselves. Our role is to help you access the services that best
        match your needs and goals — and to support the practical side of making therapy work in everyday life.

  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach to Working With Therapists</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Good allied health support is a team effort. We aim to keep communication respectful and
        focused on what’s best for you or your family member.

      <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Participant-Centred</h3>
          <p>
            You are always at the centre of decisions. We discuss options with you, listen to your
            feedback and respect your preferences about which therapists you see and how often.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Collaborative</h3>
          <p>
            With your consent, we can liaise with your therapists, Support Coordinator, GP, school
            or other services to help everyone stay aligned with your goals.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Practical & Realistic</h3>

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Allied Health Access – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-2">

        <div>
          <h3>Are you an allied health clinic?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Able Aide is not an allied health clinic. We are a disability support provider that
            helps NDIS participants access and coordinate allied health services provided by therapists.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you recommend specific therapists?</h3>
          <p>
            We can suggest options based on your location, needs and preferences, and share information
            to help you decide. We aim to remain transparent and participant-focused in all referrals.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you book appointments for me?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, we can help making and confirming bookings, and coordinating them with your other
            supports and commitments, where funded and appropriate.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you come to therapy sessions with me?</h3>
          <p>
            Where it’s helpful and within your funding, a support worker or Support Coordinator may be
            able to attend some sessions or reviews with you. We will discuss what feels right for you.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help with NDIS reports?</h3>
          <p>
            We can help you keep track of which reports are needed and when, remind you to request them,
            and communicate with providers about timelines. Therapists remain responsible for writing
            the clinical report itself.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Is this a separate service from Support Coordination?</h3>
          <p>
            It can be. Some allied health access tasks may be part of Support Coordination; others may
            be delivered as part of core or capacity supports. We can discuss how it fits best in your plan.
          </p>

          <h3>What if I’m already seeing therapists?</h3>
          <p>
            We can help you organise information, coordinate between providers and put existing recommendations
            into practice. The goal is to reduce overwhelm and help your supports work together.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you help with equipment and assistive technology?</h3>
          <p>
            We assist with the practical side, such as attending assessments and following up on recommendations.
            Prescribing and clinical decisions remain with your therapist.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help if English is not my first language?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We will always do our best to work with interpreters, bilingual workers (if available)
            and culturally appropriate services.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
          <p>
            You can contact us directly, speak with your Support Coordinator, or ask a provider to send a
            referral. We’ll talk through your goals, funding and next steps.
