        <article>
          <h2 class="section-title">1. Understand what an NDIS plan review is</h2>
          <p>
            An NDIS plan review (now often called a “plan reassessment”) is when the NDIS looks at your
            current plan, goals and supports and decides what your next plan will look like. Sometimes this is
            a full review, other times it may be a light-touch check-in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key question they’re asking is: <strong>“Are your current supports helping you work towards your
            goals, or do things need to change?”</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">2. Look back: what has worked — and what hasn’t?</h2>
          <p>
            Before your plan review, it helps to reflect on the past 6–12 months. You don’t have to write an
            essay, but some simple notes can make a big difference.
          </p>

          <h3>Questions you can ask yourself (or talk through with a support coordinator):</h3>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Which supports helped you the most? (support workers, therapists, programs, equipment)</li>
            <li>Were there supports you didn’t use — and why? (hard to access, wrong fit, no capacity)</li>
            <li>Have there been changes in your health, living situation, family or mental health?</li>
            <li>Did you feel like you had <strong>enough</strong> hours — or did things feel stretched?</li>
            <li>Are you closer to your goals, or do they need to be updated?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Writing these down in dot points is enough. You can also use a simple planner or
            <a href="/resources">downloadable worksheets</a> to keep everything in one place.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">3. Gather reports and letters from your providers</h2>
          <p>
            The NDIS usually wants to see <strong>evidence</strong> from people who support you — like therapists,
            support coordinators, support workers or doctors. These reports help explain:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Why you need the support you’re asking for</li>
            <li>What has changed since your last plan</li>
            <li>What happens if supports are reduced</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Common types of information that can help:</h3>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Occupational therapy, physio, speech or psychology reports</li>
            <li>Behaviour support plans or updates</li>
            <li>Letters from your GP or specialist</li>
            <li>Progress summaries from your support coordinator or therapists</li>
            <li>Examples of how supports help at home, in the community, work or school</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It’s a good idea to request reports <strong>at least 4–6 weeks before</strong> your review where possible
            so providers have time to prepare them.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">4. Be clear about your goals</h2>
          <p>
            Goals don’t need to sound fancy or complicated. They just need to describe what matters to you and
            what you’d like to be different or easier in the future.
          </p>

          <h3>Examples of everyday, practical goals:</h3>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>“I want to shower and dress more independently with less support.”</li>
            <li>“I want to feel confident going to appointments and doing my own shopping.”</li>
            <li>“I want my child to join in more at kinder and manage routines at home.”</li>
            <li>“I want to build a small support team around me that understands my anxiety.”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Support coordination, therapy and core supports can then be linked to these goals. This helps the
            NDIS see how funding connects to outcomes, not just tasks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">5. Think about what you need more of, less of, or different</h2>
          <p>
            Your next plan doesn’t have to look the same as your current one. Ask yourself:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Do I need <strong>more</strong> of something that is working?</li>
            <li>Is there something I didn’t use that could be reduced or removed?</li>
            <li>Do I need <strong>different</strong> supports — for example, more community access, or extra help at home?</li>
            <li>Do I need help <strong>coordinating</strong> everything (Support Coordination)?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you’re unsure, this is exactly where a <a href="/services/support-coordination">Support Coordinator</a> can help you think
            things through in a calm and structured way.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">6. Plan what you’d like to say in the meeting</h2>
          <p>
            It’s completely normal to feel nervous in NDIS phone calls or meetings. Having a few key points
            written down can help you feel less overwhelmed.
          </p>

          <h3>You might write down:</h3>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>1–3 main changes since your last plan</li>
            <li>1–3 things that are still really hard</li>
            <li>A few examples of how supports help in daily life</li>
            <li>Any safety, behaviour or mental health concerns</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You can also ask a support person to be with you — this could be a family member, trusted friend,
            <a href="/services/support-coordination">support coordinator</a> or advocate.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">7. Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Downplaying how hard things are</strong> because you don’t want to complain.</li>
            <li><strong>Saying “everything is fine”</strong> when you’re actually struggling to manage.</li>
            <li>Not mentioning changes in health, housing, family or mental health.</li>
            <li>Waiting until the last minute to request reports.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You’re not being “difficult” by explaining challenges — you’re helping the NDIS understand what a
            safe and sustainable life looks like for you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">8. When to ask for help</h2>
          <p>
            If you feel overwhelmed or unsure where to start, you don’t have to do this alone. Many people
            need support to prepare for reviews — it’s very common.
          </p>
