      <h1>Family & Early Childhood Support</h1>
      <p>
        Early years come with big changes — new routines, appointments, behaviour shifts,
        school transitions and emotional ups and downs. It can be a lot for parents and
        caregivers to navigate alone.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-subtext">
        We provide gentle, practical NDIS support to families of young children across Victoria,
        helping with routines, early development, behaviour, communication and participation at
        home, school and in the community.

    <h2 class="section-title">Helping Everyday Life Feel More Manageable</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      Many families tell us they feel pulled in every direction — managing school, therapies,
      behaviour, siblings, appointments and daily routines. We help make home life calmer,
      more predictable and easier to navigate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our support focuses on what daily life actually looks like — mornings, mealtimes, after-school
      routines, community outings, transitions and emotional regulation — not just what happens in
      appointment rooms.

<!-- APPROACH -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">

    <h2 class="section-title">Our Family-Centred Approach</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      We see families as the experts in their own children. Our role is to listen, understand and
      offer practical, realistic support that fits your values and routines.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3" style="margin-top:2rem;">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Listening First</h3>
        <p>
          We take time to understand your child’s needs, what’s working, what’s difficult and what
          you’d love to see change — without judgement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Working Alongside You</h3>
        <p>
          We build on your existing strategies and therapy input, offering small achievable steps
          rather than overwhelming plans.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Respecting Culture & Family Values</h3>
        <p>
          Every family has its own culture, language, faith and parenting style. We adapt support so
          it feels culturally safe and aligned with your values.

    <h2 class="section-title">Family & Early Support – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="grid grid-2">

      <div>
        <h3>Are you a therapy service?</h3>
        <p>No. We are not a clinical therapy service. We work alongside your child’s therapists to help families use their recommendations in daily life.</p>

        <h3>Do you replace therapists?</h3>
        <p>No — we complement therapy by supporting day-to-day routines, not clinical intervention.</p>

        <h3>Can you help with behaviours of concern?</h3>
        <p>Yes — we can follow behaviour support strategies from qualified practitioners, within our scope. Complex behaviour requires specialist input.</p>

        <h3>Do you support very young children?</h3>
        <p>Yes — including children in early childhood NDIS pathways.</p>

        <h3>Do you support siblings?</h3>
        <p>Yes — while NDIS funds the participant, we consider siblings when designing routines and support strategies.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Do you work with schools or kinders?</h3>
        <p>With your consent, yes. We support communication and consistent strategies across home, school and therapy.</p>

        <h3>Is support available after school hours?</h3>
        <p>Where capacity allows — many families prefer late afternoon support.</p>

        <h3>Can you help prepare for NDIS reviews?</h3>
        <p>Yes — we help gather information, reflect on progress and prepare examples.</p>

        <h3>How is this funded?</h3>
        <p>Usually under Core or Capacity Building, depending on goals. We can help interpret your child’s plan.</p>

        <h3>How do we start?</h3>
        <p>Contact us directly or ask your Support Coordinator or therapist to refer. We’ll talk through your situation and next steps.</p>
