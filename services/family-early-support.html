        <p>
          When a young child has additional needs, the whole family feels it. Routines, sleep, school,
          siblings, appointments, work and emotions can all become more complex. Our role is to walk
          alongside you with calm, practical support.

      <h2 class="section-title">Early Support That Fits Everyday Life</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Early support works best when it fits into real life — morning chaos, school runs, tired
        evenings, cultural and faith commitments, and everything in between. We focus on small,
        meaningful changes that make family life feel a little calmer and more manageable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work closely with parents, carers and other key people in a child’s life. Together, we look
        at what is working, where the pressure points are, and how we can gently support your child’s
        participation, communication and development within your family’s own values and routines.

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Family & Early Support – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-2">

        <div>
          <h3>Is this the same as early childhood intervention?</h3>
          <p>
            Our service is complementary to early childhood intervention. We are not therapists; we
            provide practical, family-focused support to help you implement strategies and routines in
            everyday life, alongside any therapy your child receives.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you work directly with children or mainly with parents?</h3>
          <p>
            Both. We spend time with children during routines and activities, and we also work closely
            with parents and carers, as they know their child best and are key to long-term change.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you help if we haven’t started with NDIS yet?</h3>
          <p>
            We can offer general guidance and support you to understand the process, but formal NDIS
            supports require an approved plan. We can still listen and offer suggestions about where to start.
          </p>

          <h3>Will you replace my child’s therapists or educators?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Our role is to complement, not replace, existing professionals. We help everyone work
            together around your child and family.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you provide behaviour support?</h3>
          <p>
            We are not a behaviour support provider. However, we can support families to follow strategies
            recommended by appropriately qualified practitioners, where it is safe and within scope.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Can you support siblings too?</h3>
          <p>
            While NDIS funding is focused on the participant, we recognise that siblings are part of the
            family system. We consider their needs when planning routines and supports.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you respect different parenting styles and cultures?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. We actively listen to your values, culture, language and faith, and work with you
            to find approaches that feel respectful and realistic for your family.
          </p>

          <h3>Can you attend school or kinder meetings?</h3>
          <p>
            In some cases, yes — where appropriate and funded, and with your consent, we may attend relevant
            meetings to support communication and planning.
          </p>

          <h3>How often will you visit?</h3>
          <p>
            This depends on your child’s needs, your goals and your NDIS funding. Some families prefer weekly
            visits; others prefer less frequent, but longer or more targeted support. We decide this together.
          </p>

          <h3>How do we get started?</h3>
          <p>
            You can contact us directly or speak with your Support Coordinator or plan manager. We will talk
            through your situation, funding and goals, and outline possible next steps in a gentle, no-pressure way.
